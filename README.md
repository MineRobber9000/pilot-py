# pilot-py

A WIP emulator of Pilot, the CPU behind the [HexHeld](https://github.com/hexheld) fantasy console.

## Why?

Because I felt like it, and nobody else seems to be forthcoming with anything resembling an emulator yet.

## License

Haven't decided on one yet. I promise it'll be something open-source though, debating either GPL or MIT. (It's not finished, in any case, so I wouldn't go using it if I were you.)
