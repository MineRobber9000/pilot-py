# pilot-py

A WIP emulator of Pilot-16, the CPU originally behind the [HexHeld](https://github.com/hexheld) fantasy console.

Archived because Pilot-16 is being replaced and I don't think I'll get around to finishing this anytime soon. Maybe later?

All of the code here is now officially under MIT license (it's what I would've chosen anyways) but I can't be bothered to copy/paste the license in, so you have my word in this commit that that's my intention.
